    "\n",
    "1. <a href=\"http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/datasets/sentiment/\">Multi-Domain Sentiment Dataset</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset is composed of product reviews taken from Amazon.com from many product domains like *books*, *dvds*, and *musical instruments*. Reviews contain star ratings ranged from 1 to 5 stars which can be changed to **positive** and **negative** labels respectively. Thus such a dataset is suitable for `binary sentiment classification`. There are also a few options regarding the extent to what the dataset is processed varying from the original data set to thoroughly pre-processed and label-balanced. The data set is relatively small in size. For example, the size of the pre-processed version is less than 33 MB.\n",
    "2. <a href=\"http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/\">IMDB reviews (Large Movie Review Dataset)</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset contains movie reviews for `binary sentiment classification` providing 50,000 reviews overall which are splited into 25,000 samples for training and 25,000 samples for testing. The overall distribution of labels is *balanced* (25k\n",
    "positive and 25k negative). An additional set of 50,000 unlabeled documents for unsupervised learning is also included. In the\n",
    "labeled train/test sets, a negative review has a score <= 4 out of 10, and a positive review has a score >= 7 out of 10. Thus reviews with more neutral ratings are excluded. The size of the data set is relatively small (80.2 MB).\n",
    "3. <a href=\"https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/code.html\">Stanford Sentiment Treebank</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The corpus is based on the dataset introduced by Pang and Lee (2005) and consists of 11,855 single sentences extracted from an entertainment review website Rotten Tomatoes dataset. It was parsed with the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003).\n",
    "4. <a href=\"http://help.sentiment140.com/for-students/\">Sentiment140</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset is a CSV file featuring 160,000 tweets with emoticons removed for `multiclass sentiment classification`. Data file format has 6 fields: the sentiment of the tweet (**positive**, **negative**, and **neutral**),  the tweet ID, the date of the tweet, the query, username, and the text of the tweet. The interesting fact about this data set is that the training data was automatically annotated, in contrast the basic approach is the human annotation. The main idea was based on emoticons, i.e. any tweet with positive emoticons, like :), were positive, and tweets with negative emoticons, like :(, were negative.\n",
    "5. <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment#Tweets.csv\">Twitter US Airline Sentiment</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset accumulates 14640 tweets on six US airlines such as United, US Airways, American, Southwest, Delta, and Virgin America. The tweets are classified as **positive**, **negative**, and **neutral** followed by categorizing negative reasons (such as \"late flight\" or \"rude service\"). The dataset is imbalanced and has missing values. The data is formatted under 15 fields including tweet ID, tweet location, text, airline, its sentiment, username, user timezone, etc. The size of the dataset is quite small (about 1.7 MB) which makes it easy to handle with.\n",
    "6. <a href=\"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Paper+Reviews\">Paper Reviews</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset includes paper reviews from an international conference on computing and informatics. Most of the reviews are in Spanish, and some of the reviews are in English. The total number of samples equals 405, and the reviews are assessed based on 5-point scale ('-2': **very negative**, '-1': **negative**, '0': **neutral**, '1': **positive**, '2': **very positive**). The distribution of the original scores is more or less uniform. The dataset is stored in JSON format including 10 attributes about paper ID, review ID, review text, remarks, langunage of review, evaluation score, etc. The dataset has missing values. Suitable for both `regression` and `multiclass sentiment classification` tasks.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. <a href=\"http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Sentiment+Labelled+Sentences\">Sentiment Labelled Sentences Data Set</a>\n",

    "The datasets contains sentences extracted from reviews of products, movies, and restaurants and labelled with **positive** or **negative** sentiment. The sentences are derived from three different websites\n",
    "+ imdb.com (movies reviews)\n",
    "+ amazon.com (product reviews, mostly mobile phones, headsets, and some other phone accessories)\n",
    "+ yelp.com (restaurants reviews)\n",
    "\n",
    "For each website, there are 500 positive and 500 negative sentences that ensure the dataset to be balanced. Altogether the dataset consists of 3,000 instances. Thus it's a medium sized which allows to browse the whole dataset as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. <a href=\"http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/\">IMDB reviews (Large Movie Review Dataset)</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset provides sufficient data for both **positive** and **negative** sentiments which are uniformly distributed (label-balanced). Length of individual reviews is longer (than a single sentence like in `Sentiment Labelled Sentences Data Set`). Already known in NLP & ML community. Suitable for `binary sentiment classification`."

       "['Bromwell High is a cartoon comedy. It ran at the same time as some other programs about school life, such as \"Teachers\". My 35 years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that Bromwell High\\'s satire is much closer to reality than is \"Teachers\". The scramble to survive financially, the insightful students who can see right through their pathetic teachers\\' pomp, the pettiness of the whole situation, all remind me of the schools I knew and their students. When I saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school, I immediately recalled ......... at .......... High. A classic line: INSPECTOR: I\\'m here to sack one of your teachers. STUDENT: Welcome to Bromwell High. I expect that many adults of my age think that Bromwell High is far fetched. What a pity that it isn\\'t!\\n',\n",
       " 'Homelessness (or Houselessness as George Carlin stated) has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered human who did everything from going to school, work, or vote for the matter. Most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause while worrying about things such as racism, the war on Iraq, pressuring kids to succeed, technology, the elections, inflation, or worrying if they\\'ll be next to end up on the streets.<br /><br />But what if you were given a bet to live on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from a home, the entertainment sets, a bathroom, pictures on the wall, a computer, and everything you once treasure to see what it\\'s like to be homeless? That is Goddard Bolt\\'s lesson.<br /><br />Mel Brooks (who directs) who stars as Bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until deciding to make a bet with a sissy rival (Jeffery Tambor) to see if he can live in the streets for thirty days without the luxuries; if Bolt succeeds, he can do what he wants with a future project of making more buildings. The bet\\'s on where Bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he can\\'t step off the sidewalk. He\\'s given the nickname Pepto by a vagrant after it\\'s written on his forehead where Bolt meets other characters including a woman by the name of Molly (Lesley Ann Warren) an ex-dancer who got divorce before losing her home, and her pals Sailor (Howard Morris) and Fumes (Teddy Wilson) who are already used to the streets. They\\'re survivors. Bolt isn\\'t. He\\'s not used to reaching mutual agreements like he once did when being rich where it\\'s fight or flight, kill or be killed.<br /><br />While the love connection between Molly and Bolt wasn\\'t necessary to plot, I found \"Life Stinks\" to be one of Mel Brooks\\' observant films where prior to being a comedy, it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, or Spaceballs for the matter, to show what it\\'s like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they don\\'t know what to do with their money. Maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like Monopoly money.<br /><br />Or maybe this film will inspire you to help others.\\n']"

For example, adjectives learnt by a classifier like `great`, `good`, `best`, `nice`, `excellent`, `perfect`are quite representative.

    "All the features used to define the **positive sentiment** of the review look very illustrative and representative following the intuition people are guided while expressing their attitude towards something. For example, *positive* features like `excellent`, `great`, `perfect`, and `wonderful` are the very common adjective people use widely to show their affection, admiration, anthusiasm about something. The same can be said about features considered as *negative* for **positive sentiment** class meaning that for **negative sentiment** class they are regarded *positive* in contrast. Most of them are adjectives as well which are widely used to reflect distaste, abomination, and hatred. Adjectives like `dull`, `terrible`, `horrible`, `bad`, `boring`, and `awful` are great examples. Additionally, while training, the classifier managed to identify some of the verbs like `lacks`, `fails`, `waste` which are used to express the same feelings. Overall the features look very decent!\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, there are some numbers that can be noticed among the other features. They look quite confusing. Although, we can make a guess about their origin taking into account some essential characteristics related to the dataset. According to the dataset description, a positive review has a score $\\geq$ 7 out of 10. Thus `7` can refer to a review score which might be mentioned in the review. Numbers like `310`, `410`, and `710` might also imply the review's evaluation by a user as these can mean `3 out of 10 or 3/10`, `4 out of 10 or 4/10`, `4 out of 10 or 4/10` respectively. They way how they are formated can be explained by the regular expressions we used when cleaned up the raw movie reviews."

    "As a native speaker of the Russian language, I (Aleksandr Krylov) have to say that all the features look very representative and illustrative. For instance, the most important *positive* features for **positive** reviews reflect the most common words used by Russians to show affection, enthusiasm, passion, interest, admiration, and delight in case of positive attitude towards something. Features like `отличный = great`, `хороший = good`, `веселый = funny` are perfect examples of adjectives widely used by Russian speakers to give a like to something. Additionally, some of the common Russian verbs for such feelings have been detected while training the sentiment classifier. Good examples of such features are `люблю = to love`, `доволен = to be satisfied`, `рекомендую = to recommend`.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about the features considered to be *negative* towards the extent to which a review can be treated as **positive** (the same features are *positive* in the context of recognizing **negative** reviews), these features are also very demonstrative and explanatory in terms of publical intuition and perception to express dislike, distaste, hatred, antipathy, and disapproval. The most illustrative features are like `пллохой = bad`, `худший = the worst`, `ужасно = terribly`. More than that, some of the features are represented by very vivid verbs like `избегайте = to avoid`, `ненавижу = to hate`, `разочарован = to be disappointed` used in Russian to describe the degree to which a person dislikes something. Besides, during the training the classifier has managed to capture Russian negative contractions `не` and `нет` which are equivalent to `no` and `don't/doesn't` in the English language. And more surprisingly, the classifer has managed to detect a Russian *slang* word like `отстой = mess/rubbish` used to describe something very bad and shitty.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing we have to point out concerning the classifier's performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score and learnt features altogether is that the overall results drastically depend on the quality of translation. Keeping in mind all the results we have, we guess that Google translate did very good job so that everything seems quite reasonable."
